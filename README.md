Principal Component Analysis for Images

This Project explores the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for detecting uncorrelated anomalies or noise in digital images. 

PCA, a dimensionality reduction technique, is applied to decompose image data into principal components that capture the dominant variance. The analysis focuses on understanding how the number of retained eigenvectors (princi-
pal components) influences the quality of anomaly detection and image reconstruction. 

A grayscale version of the input image is used to simplify computation while preserving essential structural information. The results demonstrate that a smaller number of eigenvectors may fail to represent fine image details, while too many components may reintroduce noise. Thus, an optimal balance is necessary for effective noise and anomaly detection.
